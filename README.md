# AI Experimentation Projects - SHIFT WEEK

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: EXPERIMENTAL AI-GENERATED PROJECTS ⚠️

This repository contains multiple **prototype** projects created **primarily through AI assistance**. Both the code and documentation were largely generated by AI as experiments in AI-assisted development.

## Project Purpose

This collection of projects exists solely as experiments to explore:
- How AI can assist in generating functional software
- The capabilities and limitations of AI-generated software
- The process of developing tools with minimal human intervention
- Different approaches to AI-assisted software development

## Important Notices

- **Not Production Ready**: This code should not be used in production environments.
- **Limited Testing**: The code has undergone minimal testing and may contain bugs, security vulnerabilities, or other issues.
- **No Warranty**: These projects are provided "as is" without any warranties of any kind.
- **No Maintenance**: This repository may not be actively maintained.

## Potential Risks

Using this code may lead to:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Incorrect or incomplete functionality
- Unexpected behavior or crashes
- Resource consumption issues (memory, CPU, network)
- Compatibility issues with different environments

## Project Overview

This repository contains the following sub-projects:

1. **[GitHub Summarizer](./github-summarizer)**: A tool that analyzes GitHub repository activity and generates AI summaries
2. **[Doc-RAG-Bot](./doc-rag-bot)**: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for querying documentation
3. **[HCP Agent](./hcp-agent)**: A Hosted Control Plane agent for cluster health reports
4. **[Kubernetes Controller Visualizer](./kube-controller-viz)**: A visualization tool for Kubernetes controller operations

Each project has its own README with specific details about its functionality and usage.

## Educational Value

Despite their experimental nature, these projects demonstrate:
- Integration with various APIs and systems
- Language model prompt engineering
- Different architectural approaches to AI-enhanced applications
- Implementation patterns for specific domains

## License

This experimental code is made available under MIT license.

## Acknowledgment

These projects were created as experiments in AI-assisted development. The vast majority of code, documentation, and design was generated by AI, with human guidance and minor modifications.
