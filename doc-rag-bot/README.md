# Doc-RAG-Bot - AI Prototype

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: EXPERIMENTAL AI-GENERATED PROJECT ⚠️

This repository contains a **prototype** documentation retrieval and question-answering bot created **primarily through AI assistance**. Both the code and this README were largely generated by AI as an experiment in AI-assisted development.

## Project Purpose

This project exists solely as an experiment to explore:
- How AI can assist in generating functional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- The capabilities and limitations of AI-generated software
- The process of developing tools with minimal human intervention

## Important Notices

- **Not Production Ready**: This code should not be used in production environments.
- **Limited Testing**: The code has undergone minimal testing and may contain bugs, security vulnerabilities, or other issues.
- **No Warranty**: This project is provided "as is" without any warranties of any kind.
- **No Maintenance**: This repository may not be actively maintained.

## Potential Risks

Using this code may lead to:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Incorrect or incomplete information retrieval and responses
- Hallucinations or incorrect answers from the LLM component
- Unexpected behavior or crashes
- Resource consumption issues (memory, CPU, network)

## Project Overview

The Doc-RAG-Bot is a tool that:
1. Ingests documentation from specified sources
2. Creates embeddings and stores them for retrieval
3. Retrieves relevant documentation snippets based on user queries
4. Uses a language model to generate answers based on the retrieved context

## Requirements

- Go 1.20+
- Access to Ollama running locally
- Sufficient storage for document embeddings

## Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build and run the application (using make)
make run

# Or build manually
go build -o bin/doc-rag-bot cmd/main.go

# Run with custom options
./bin/doc-rag-bot --docs=./my-docs --ollama-url=http://localhost:11434 --embedding-model=llama3 --llm-model=qwen2.5

# Available commands in the interactive CLI:
# list - List all indexed documents
# show <filename> - Show the content of a document
# exit - Exit the program
# [any question] - Ask a question about the indexed documents
```

## Educational Value

Despite its experimental nature, this project demonstrates:
- Implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system
- Document chunking and embedding strategies
- Vector database integration
- Prompt engineering for context-based responses
- Integration with language models

This experimental code is made available under MIT license.

## Acknowledgment

This project was created as an experiment in AI-assisted development. The vast majority of code, documentation, and design was generated by AI, with human guidance and minor modifications.
