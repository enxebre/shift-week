# GitHub Activity Summarizer - AI Prototype

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: EXPERIMENTAL AI-GENERATED PROJECT ⚠️

This repository contains a **prototype** GitHub activity summarization tool created **primarily through AI assistance**. Both the code and this README were largely generated by AI as an experiment in AI-assisted development.

## Project Purpose

This project exists solely as an experiment to explore:
- How AI can assist in generating functional code
- The capabilities and limitations of AI-generated software
- The process of developing tools with minimal human intervention

## Important Notices

- **Not Production Ready**: This code should not be used in production environments.
- **Limited Testing**: The code has undergone minimal testing and may contain bugs, security vulnerabilities, or other issues.
- **No Warranty**: This project is provided "as is" without any warranties of any kind.
- **No Maintenance**: This repository may not be actively maintained.

## Potential Risks

Using this code may lead to:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Incorrect or incomplete data processing
- Rate limiting or API usage issues with GitHub
- Unexpected behavior or crashes
- Resource consumption issues (memory, CPU, network)

## Project Overview

The GitHub Activity Summarizer is a command-line tool that:
1. Fetches recent issues and pull requests from a specified GitHub repository
2. Uses AI to analyze and summarize the repository activity
3. Generates concise reports of key activity and trends

This tool could also analyze which PRs need to retest a specific test, or deserve a hold or need some labels and apply all that by creating a GH comment via llm func calling, and that could be an agent that runs periodically

## Requirements

- Node.js
- GitHub access token
- OpenAI API key or similar LLM API access

## Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set environment variables
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# Run summarizer
node src/main.js --repo owner/repo --days 7
```

## Educational Value

Despite its experimental nature, this project demonstrates:
- Integration with GitHub API
- LLM prompt engineering for structured summaries
- Handling asynchronous API requests
- Data extraction and transformation
- CLI design patterns

## License

This experimental code is made available under MIT license.

## Acknowledgment

This project was created as an experiment in AI-assisted development. The vast majority of code, documentation, and design was generated by AI, with human guidance and minor modifications.
