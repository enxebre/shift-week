# HCP Agent - AI Prototype

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: EXPERIMENTAL AI-GENERATED PROJECT ⚠️

This repository contains a **prototype** Hosted Control Plane agent created **primarily through AI assistance**. Both the code and this README were largely generated by AI as an experiment in AI-assisted development.

## Project Purpose

This project exists solely as an experiment to explore:
- How AI can assist in generating functional cloud-native infrastructure agents
- The capabilities and limitations of AI-generated software
- The process of developing tools with minimal human intervention

## Important Notices

- **Not Production Ready**: This code should not be used in production environments.
- **Limited Testing**: The code has undergone minimal testing and may contain bugs, security vulnerabilities, or other issues.
- **No Warranty**: This project is provided "as is" without any warranties of any kind.
- **No Maintenance**: This repository may not be actively maintained.

## Potential Risks

Using this code may lead to:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Incorrect or incomplete infrastructure management
- System instability or resource leaks
- Unexpected behavior or crashes
- Resource consumption issues (memory, CPU, network)

## Project Overview

The HCP Agent is a tool that:
1. Communicates with a hosted control plane service
2. Make cluster health reporsts

## Requirements

- Go 1.17+
- Kubernetes cluster access
- Network connectivity to control plane services

## Usage

```bash
# Build the agent
make build

# Configure agent
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with appropriate values

# Run agent
./bin/hcp-agent --config config.yaml
```

## Educational Value

Despite its experimental nature, this project demonstrates:
- Implementation of a Kubernetes operator pattern
- Secure communication protocols for remote control planes
- Infrastructure abstraction techniques
- State management and reconciliation logic
- Integration with cloud provider APIs

## License

This experimental code is made available under MIT license.

## Acknowledgment

This project was created as an experiment in AI-assisted development. The vast majority of code, documentation, and design was generated by AI, with human guidance and minor modifications.
