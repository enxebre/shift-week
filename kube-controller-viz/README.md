# Kubernetes Controller Visualizer - AI Prototype

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: EXPERIMENTAL AI-GENERATED PROJECT ⚠️

This repository contains a **prototype** Kubernetes controller visualization tool created **primarily through AI assistance**. Both the code and this README were largely generated by AI as an experiment in AI-assisted development.

## Project Purpose

This project exists solely as an experiment to explore:
- How AI can assist in generating functional visualization tools for Kubernetes
- The capabilities and limitations of AI-generated software
- The process of developing tools with minimal human intervention

## Important Notices

- **Not Production Ready**: This code should not be used in production environments.
- **Limited Testing**: The code has undergone minimal testing and may contain bugs, security vulnerabilities, or other issues.
- **No Warranty**: This project is provided "as is" without any warranties of any kind.
- **No Maintenance**: This repository may not be actively maintained.

## Potential Risks

Using this code may lead to:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Incorrect or misleading visualizations of controller behavior
- Performance issues when processing large log volumes
- Unexpected behavior or crashes
- Resource consumption issues (memory, CPU, network)

## Project Overview

The Kubernetes Controller Visualizer is a tool that:
1. Parses Kubernetes controller logs
2. Extracts key events and reconciliation steps
3. Visualizes the flow of controller operations
4. Helps identify bottlenecks or issues in controller behavior

## Requirements

- Node.js for the frontend
- Go for the backend server
- Access to Kubernetes controller logs

## Usage

```bash
# Start the backend
cd backend
./bin/server -log-file=sample.log

# Start the frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

# View visualization at http://localhost:3000
```

## Educational Value

Despite its experimental nature, this project demonstrates:
- Log parsing and data extraction techniques
- Visualization of asynchronous controller reconciliation flows
- Frontend/backend separation of concerns
- Interactive UI for debugging complex systems
